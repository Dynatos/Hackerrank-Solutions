There is a collection of input strings and a collection of query strings. For each query string, determine how many times it occurs in the list of input strings.

For example, given input strings = ['ab', ' ab', 'abc'] and queries = ['ab', 'abc', 'bc'],
we find 2 instances of 'ab', 1 of 'abc' and 0 of 'bc'. for each query, we add an element to our return array, results = [2, 1, 0].
